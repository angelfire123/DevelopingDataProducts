DevelopingDataProducts
======================
The scope of this file is to allow the user to familiarize with the developed application and be able to use its functionality.

This application uses the mtcars which is part of R library environment. This way the application has no dependency on any custom data in order to run.

The application is structured in two panels: input panel or left navigation; and result panel (main panel). Result panel has two tabs which display the information processed (by user's input) in two visual representations: graphic (histogram) or table format (printing the summary).

On the input panel, the user has a drop down with different data types from mycars: cylinders, mpg, horse power and so on. User will select one of the values from the drop down. The application will take user's input and will display on the main panel the histogram or summary of that data (in different tabs).
